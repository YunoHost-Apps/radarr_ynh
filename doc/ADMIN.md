* Access control is done with YunoHost's permissions system.
  * API (`domain.tld/path/api`) can be accessed by visitors to allow control by remote clients.
* The app uses YunoHost's multimedia directories, hence it has write access to users' and shared directories in `/home/yunohost.multimedia`. After installation, you can choose these directories to store your media.
